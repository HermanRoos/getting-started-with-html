<h3>The basics to the web</h3>

<p>The web was invented in the 1990's and has billions of pages. 
It consists out of a collection of HTML documents which is explained under the heading: The basics of HTML</p>

<p><em>Here are the mayor pieces of the web coming together:</em> The user must run a Web Browser (e.g Google Chrome) 
on a computer which is connected to the internet which sends a request via the internet (This protocol/request 
is named <b>HTTP</b> - a <em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em>) to servers that hosts large amounts of files 
(e.g HTML files) which will respond accordingly with HTML files that will then be interpreted and displayed 
accordingly in the users web browser.</p>

<h3>The basics to HTML (<em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em>)</h3>

<p><b>HTML</b> is the <em>main document type</em> of the web which glues everything together. 
From normal text, to videos, images, audio, documents etc. It is the heart of the web.</p>

<u>HTML is made up of the following:</u><br>
<em>Text content</em> - What you see.<br>
<em>Markup</em> - What gives a webpage its look/styling and layout.<br>
<em>References</em> - To documents such as videos, images, audio, etc.<br>
<em>Links</em> - To other web pages.

<p><b>HTML <em>Markup</em></b> consists out of a series of <b>tags</b> which is used within <b>elements</b>. 
There are virtually endless combinations of tags that one can put together 
in your HTML document to make a webpage unique and rich.</p>

<p><u>The difference between a <b>Tag</b> and an <b>Element</b> in a HTML document:</u><br>
<em>Tag</em> = A <u>single</u> opening or closing entity/tag.<br>
<em>Element</em> = Consists out of an <u>opening tag</u>, <u>closing tag</u> and the <u>contents</u> in between.</p>

It is <u>very important</u> to remember that <b>"Computers are stupid".</b><br>
Saying that a computer is stupid is more of a figure of speech.
The reason being, a computer will and can only read/interpret the contents of an HTML document it opens. 
So it is extremely important for the programmers to make 100% sure that all of their work is correct with 
whole elements, tags, etc. If not, there can be mayor problems and issues.</p>

<p><u>The difference between an <b>Inline</b> Element and a <b>Block</b> Element in a HTML document:</u><br>
<em>Inline</em> = The BREAK tag for example, will keep the the text normal "clean" text.<br>
<em>Block</em> = The PARAGRAPH tag for example, makes an Invisible box around text that has a certain Height and Width around it.</p>
